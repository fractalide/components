= Services

== What?

`Services` are reusable and consist of `agents`, `subgraphs` and `edges`. They may be connected to other `services` on the same system or on remote machines in a high performance cluster quite easily.

== Why?

`Services` allow programmers to collaborate and distill common configurable patterns that solve general problems.
Essentially a `service` in this context is no different from a top level `subgraph`, albeit the interface has been `nix`'ified. The `nix` interface is required because this is where `nixos` takes over and declaratively handles congruent configuration management. It does things like set up dependencies such as databases and other services that might need to be run for the `subgraph` to operate properly. This layer of software has been well tested by the `nix` community and ties in with every other service created by the `nixos` community.

This abstraction allows you to pull in legacy services, plug a Cap'n Proto functionality and start talking to Fractalide services.

== Who?

Anyone who has completed a high quality, documented hierarchy of components, subnets and contracts, and where the hierarchy makes sense to expose as a service. We use the [C4](../CONTRIBUTING.md) so your `services` will be merged in quickly.

== Where?

`Service` implementations by convention exist in a <<fractals,`fractal's`>> root https://github.com/fractalide/fractal_workbench/blob/master/service.nix[folder]. It doesn't make sense to expose every `fractal` as a service. Though if the `fractal` is dependent on other services such as databases, then it might make sense. Nevertheless, the fractals which have a `service.nix` may have their components and contracts imported into higher level subnets via the <<fractals>> importing mechanism. This higher level subnet may then be exposed as a `service`.

== How?

* First create a <<fractals,`fractal`>>
* Update the `service.nix` file to reflect what options you want exposed on the service interface.
* Ensure the `subnet` you want is correctly configured.
* Add a line the `fractalide/services/default.nix` where you make your service visible to the rest of the `fractalide` community.

=== Two ways to run a service

==== From your Fractal

This approach is when you have a service you don't consider generic and is not worth sharing with the community.

in your `configuration.nix` put these lines:

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.configuration.nix
----
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
let
  fractalide = import fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "fractalide";
    repo = "fractalide";
    rev = "b9590b6{ git revision you want }f130ed79432c722";
    sha256 = "0jz58mmax5{ correct sha256 generated by nix }yycmzr26xwfqa";
  } {};
in
{
  require = fractalide.services ++ [ "/path/to/private/dev/fractals/fractal_your_fractal/service.nix" ];
  services.workbench = {
    enable = true;
    bindAddress = "192.168.0.14";
    port = 8000;
  };
  services.your_service = {
    enable = true;
    bindAddress = "192.168.0.15";
    port = 8001;
  };
  # ... other options you want
}

==== From Fractalide

in your `configuration.nix` put these lines:

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.configuration.nix
----
let
  fractalide = import fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "fractalide";
    repo = "fractalide";
    rev = "b9590b6{ git revision you want }f130ed79432c722";
    sha256 = "0jz58mmax5{ correct sha256 generated by nix }yycmzr26xwfqa";
  } {};
in
{
require = fractalide.services;
services.workbench = {
        enable = true;
        bindAddress = "127.0.0.1";
        port = 8000;
};
# ... other options you want
----

* At this point, you may either choose to build `nixops` infrastructure scripts and deploy or simply run `$ nixos-rebuild {test, boot , switch}` to set up the services on your own system.
* Do help out building generic services for programmers to speed up their work!
