= Fractals

Fractals are third party Fractalide libraries.

== What?

`Fractals` are importable 3rd party sets of nodes, subgraphs and edges, this folder hierarchy is the single source of truth regarding where to find each community fractal.

== Why?

`Fractals` allow the community to develop their own projects in their own git repository, and once ready, may plug into `dev/fractalide/fractals` folder hierarchy which represents the spine of Fractalide. Once inserted your `fractal` is available for use by everyone.

== Who?

Anyone making high quality, documented nodes, subgraphs and edges may plug into this folder hierarchy. We use the https://github.com/fractalide/fractalide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[C4] so your `fractals` will be merged in quickly.

== Where?

Each `fractal` needs to have its own hierarchical folder. For example, HTTP would be placed in the `fractalide/fractals/net/http` folder.

== How?

Say you wish to create a `http` project, these are the exact steps involved:

* Ensure you use this directory structure convention:

[source, sh]
----
dev
├── fractalide
│   └── fractals
│       └── net
│           └── http
│               └── default.nix
└── fractals
    ├── fractal_net_http
    └── ... more community fractals cloned
----

[source, sh]
----
$ cd <your/development/directory>
$ git clone \https://gitlab.com/fractalide/fractalide.git
$ NIX_PATH="nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/125ffff089b6bd360c82cf986d8cc9b17fc2e8ac.tar.gz:fractalide=/path/to/dev/fractalide" && export NIX_PATH` <1>
$ mkdir dev/fractals && cd dev/fractals
$ git clone git://github.com/fractalide/fractal_workbench.git fractal_net_http <2>
$ git remote set-url origin git://new.url.you.control.here 
$ mkdir -p dev/fractalide/fractals/net/http/ <3>
----

<1> Take note when setting the `NIX_PATH` environment variable, it must include the path to your newly cloned `fractalide` repo i.e.: `NIX_PATH=...:fractalide=/path/to/dev/fractalide`. +
Should you start a new shell, type `<ctrl>-r` then type `125ff` this will search your command history for the above command, or just persist the command in your `~/.bashrc` file.

<2> The `fractal_workbench` repo provides a minimum correct structure for your `fractal`.  Keep the repo naming convention `fractal_*` for your repo as it'll be easy for the community to see this is a `fractalide` related project.

<3> Create your needed directory hierarchy `dev/fractalide/fractals/net/http/default.nix`.

Insert the below code into a file called `default.nix` which sits in the above folder.

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.dev/fractalide/fractals/net/http/default.nix
----
{ pkgs
, support
, edges
, nodes
, fetchFromGitHub
, ...}:
let
  fractal = fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "fractalide";
    repo = "fractal_net_http";
    rev = "66ad3bf74b04627edc71227b3e5b944561854367";
    sha256 = "1vs1d3d9lbxnyilx8g45pb01z5cl2z3gy4035h24p28p9v94jx1b";
  };
  /*fractal = ../../../../fractals/fractal_net_http;*/
in
  import fractal {inherit pkgs support edges nodes; fractalide = null;}
----

[NOTE]
====
* The `pkgs`, `support`, `nodes`, `edges` and `fetchFromGitHub` are arguments passed into this closure.
* The `let` expression contains a `fetchFromGitHub` expression describing the location of the `fractal`.
** `owner` of the git repository i.e.: `github.com/fractalide`
** `repo` is the git repository in question i.e.: `github.com/fractalide/fractal_net_http`
** `rev` indicates the git revision you want to import i.e.: `https://github.com/fractalide/fractal_net_http/commit/66ad3bf74b04627edc71227b3e5b944561854367`
** `sha256` is a neat `nix` mechanism to assist in deterministic builds. To obtain the correct `sha256` try build your project with an incorrect `sha256` (change the first alpha-numeric character in `1vs1d3d9lbxnyilx8g45pb01z5cl2z3gy4035h24p28p9v94jx1b` to a `2`). Nix will download the repository and check that the actual `sha256` matches against what you incorrectly inserted. Nix will tell you what the correct `sha256` is. Copy it and insert the correct `sha256`, replacing `2vs1d3d9lbxnyilx8g45pb01z5cl2z3gy4035h24p28p9v94jx1b`.
* Please notice the line: `/\*fractal = ../../../../fractals/fractal_net_http;*/` This line allows you to tell nix not to refer to the remote repo but your local clone of `fractal_net_http`. Comment out the `fetchFromGitHub` expression and uncomment the above local repo clone path. When you publish your `fractal` upstream, ensure this line is commented out! Please use a relative path compatible with the above directory structure convention as it will work for everyone and we don't have to hunt for the correct folder. Just un/comment and go!
* The line: `import fractal {inherit pkgs support edges nodes; fractalide = null;}` is where we import your closures into `fractalide`'s set of closures. Thus making your nodes available to everyone.
====

The last step is to expose the exact nodes / edges to `dev/fractalide/nodes/default.nix` and `dev/fractalide/edges/default.nix`. +
This is done in this manner:

* Open `dev/fractalide/nodes/default.nix` and seek out the `net_http_nodes` attribute. This is what it looks like:
`net_http_nodes = fractals.net_http.nodes;`
In this case there is no specific top level node you'd wish to expose so the convention `*_nodes` is used to indicate this. Whereas if you have a specific node you'd wish to expose then you'd name it as such:
`net_http = fractals.net_http.nodes.http`. Why the `*.http`? well that's what the node is named in the namespace https://github.com/fractalide/fractal_net_http/blob/master/nodes/default.nix#L5[here]. Please notice the lack of the `*_nodes` when exporting a single node.
* Regarding importing edges, typically you don't need to import edges, but there are times when you need a special edge which must operate on the public side of the `fractal` and thus usable across a number of `fractals`, say the https://github.com/fractalide/fractal_net_http/blob/master/edges/default.nix#L8[`net_http_edges.request`]
You'd use a https://github.com/fractalide/fractalide/blob/2312ac77fbb09f7a6cb2d29b79496a83aade3852/edges/default.nix#L31[similar mechanism] as above when exposing your edges.

== Incremental Builds

Incremental Builds speed up the development process, so that one doesn't have to compile the entire crate from scratch each time you make a change to the source code.

Fractalide expands the nix-build system for incremental builds. The Incremental Builds only work when debug is enabled. They also need the path to a cache folder.
The cache folder can be created from an old result by the `buildCache.sh` script. Per default the cache folder is saved in the `/tmp` folder of your system. Incremental Builds permit you to compile a crate without having to recompile the crate dependency tree.

Here is an example how you can build with the Incremental Build System:

[source, sh]
----
$ cd dev/fractalide
$ nix-build --argstr debug true --argstr cache $(./support/buildCache.sh) --argstr subgraph workbench
----

If you're using NixOS, please ensure you have not set `nix.useSandbox = true;`, otherwise Incremental Compilation will fail.

== There is a `service.nix` file! What is it?

* Please read <<services,this>>.

== Two ways to execute your fractal

=== Executing from within Fractalide

[source, sh]
----
$ cd dev/fractalide
$ nix-build --argstr rs workbench
$ ./result
----

* advantages
** Incremental recompilation needed for development
* disadvantages
** wetware needed to plug into `dev/fractalide/fractals` to get incremental recompilation
** long build command


=== Executing from with the Fractal

[source, sh]
----
$ cd /dev/fractals/fractal_workbench
$ nix-build
$ ./result
----

* advantages
** faster to test by just issuing the `nix-build` command
** convenient for CI & CD of you specific subgraph
** don't have to plug it into `dev/fractalide/fractals`
* disadvantages
** no incremental recompilation
