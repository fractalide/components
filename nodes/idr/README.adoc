== What?

Executable `Subgraphs` are defined as a network of `Agents`, which exchange typed data across predefined connections by message passing, where the connections are specified externally to the processes. These `Agents`  can be reconnected endlessly to form different executable `Subgraphs` without having to be changed internally.

== Why?

Functions in a programming language should be placed in a content addressable store, this is the horizontal plane. The vertical plane should be constructed using unique addresses into this content addressable store, critically each address should solve a single problem, and may do so by referencing multiple other unique addresses in the content addressable store. Users must not have knowledge of these unique addresses but a translation process should occur from a human readable name to a universally unique address. Read http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2011-May/058768.html[more] about the problem.

Nix gives us the content addressable store which allows for `reproducibility`, and these `agents` give us `reusability`. The combination is particularly potent form of programming.

Once you have the above, you have truly reusable and reproducible functions. Fractalide nodes are just this, and it makes the below so much easier to achieve:

[source]
----
* Open source collaboration
* Open peer review of nodes
* Nice clean reusable nodes
* Reproducible applications
----

== Who?

Typically programmers will develop `Agents`. They specialize in making `Agents` as efficient and reusable as possible, while people who focus on the Science give the requirements and use the `Subgraphs`. Just as a hammer is designed to be reused, so `Subgraphs` and `Agents` should be designed for reuse.

== Where?

The `Agents` are found in this `nodes` directory, or the `nodes` directory of a <<fractal,fractal>>.

[source, sh]
----
nodes
└── idr
    └── file
        └── open
            ├── File <--- contains the `file_open` idris agent code
            │   └── *.idr
            ├── Tests <--- contains the `file_open` idris agent tests
            │   └── *.idr
            ├── default.nix <--- configures the environment to compile the agent
            └── agent.ipkg <--- `idris` uses the deps made available by `default.nix`
----

When you see an `agent.ipkg` in the same directory as a `default.nix` you know it's an `Agent`.

== How?

An `Agent` consists of three parts:

* a `nix` `default.nix` file that sets up an environment to satisfy the `idris` repl/compiler.
* an `idris` `agent.ipkg` tells idris how to compile the source code in the directories.
* the `idris` `*.idr` source code within capitalized directories.

=== The `agent` Nix function.

The `agent` function in the `default.nix` requires you make decisions about three types of dependencies.

* What `edges` inter-agent idris types are to be pulled in?
* What `mods` which are idris library dependencies available online.
* What `osdeps` or `operating system level dependencies` are needed?

[source, nix, subs="none"]
----
{ agent, edges, mods, pkgs }:

agent {
  src = ./.;
  edges = with edges.idr; [ TestVect ];
  mods = with mods.idr; [ contrib ];
  osdeps = with pkgs; [ openssl ];
}
----

* The `{ agent, edges, mods, pkgs }:` lambda imports: The `edges` attribute which consists of every `edge` available on the system. The `mods` attribute set consists of every `mod` in the `modules/idr` directory. Lastly the `pkgs` pulls in every third party package available on NixOS, here's the whole http://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html[list].
* The `agent` function builds the idris `agent.ipkg` and associated source code, and accepts these arguments:
** The `src` attribute is used to derive the source code and `Agent` name based on location in the `nodes` directory hierarchy.
** The `edges` makes inter-agent `idris` types available just before build time.
** The `mods` specifies exactly which `modules` are needed for the agent to build.
** The `osdeps` specifies exactly which `pkgs`, or third party `operating system level libraries` such as `openssl` needed in scope.

Only specified dependencies and their transitive dependencies will be pulled into scope once the `agent` compilation starts, or when you run a development shell.

This is the output of the above ``agent``'s compilation:

[source, sh]
----
/nix/store/dp8s7d3p80q18a3pf2b4dk0bi4f856f8-file_open
└── lib
    └── libagent.js

=== nix-shell

It's convenient to use a REPL, idris-mode with your editor while developing an agent.

Here are the steps to setup a development environment.

In the root directory of fractalide, issue these commands:

* `$ nix-shell -A mods.idr.idrisfbp` <- or whatever the attribute path of the idris agent you want
* `$ cd modules/idr/idrisfbp` <- `cd` to your chosen agent in the `nodes` hierachy
* `$ source $setup`
* `$ build`
* `$ run emacs .`

For the `run` command to work you need to have installed your editor via your system level `configuration.nix` file, as it references the `/run/current-system/sw/bin/*` path.

You may also start a REPL and use your integrated idris-modes in your editor. Note all the dependencies have been `alias`'ed to `idris`.

```
$ type idris
idris is aliased to `idris -i /nix/store/0ijgdwdb9bfwwkgcxac25p2mxl161ljb-base-1.1.0/lib/1.1.0-git:PRE/base -i /nix/store/12cs9pgsdq4rhnzxjdk5hqv5rc9v60pb-prelude-1.1.0/lib/1.1.0-git:PRE/prelude -i /nix/store/506r1qqayw6j2nb4dsfvb716n9x8ndmj-contrib-1.1.0/lib/1.1.0-git:PRE/contrib -i /home/stewart/dev/fractalide/fractalide/modules/idr/idrisfbp/idris_libs'
```
Each `idris` command in each agent development environment will contain a different set of associated alias'ed paths.
It might be a good idea to create a throw away agent that contains all the useful dependencies, create a development shell using that agent then navigate around the `nodes` hierarchy without closing your editer each time.
